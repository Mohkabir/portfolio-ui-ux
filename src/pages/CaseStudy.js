              In 2021, major economies have taken a hit putting the world in
              turmoil, this makes these times an opportunity to build seamless
              intuitive money lending solutions, a lot of businesses and
              companies have been hit hard with the recession and also the COVID
              19 virus couldn't have come at a far worse time than this.
            </p>
            <p>
              A recent stat from the International labour organization said â€œIn
              2020, 8.8 percent of global working hours were lost relative to
              the fourth quarter of 2019, equivalent to 255 million full-time
              jobs. Globally, the decline in working hours in 2020 translated
              into both employment losses and a reduction in working hours for
              those who remained employed, with significant variation across
              regions' '.

              This has left people with no choice than to see alternatives for

              spending out their investments carrot offers to keep their
              investment positions and take loans based on their portfolio

            <h4>Research</h4>
            <p>
              With a huge population of middle-class people in Nigeria, the
              lending space is growing exponentially. Carrying out research on
              Carrot was almost like a walk in the park if you actually only
              take facts out from what all users think because every user wants
              more money and also certainly at no cost.
            </p>
            <p>
              To kick things off, I conducted primary research to gain a general
              understanding of the lending market. This encompassed examining a
              wide range of microenterprises, SMEs, groups, and individuals who
              offer loans, to understand how services are being run in the
              lending industry.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main aim was to understand and connect user goals and business
              goals. I carried out user research, workshops, and built a solid
              understanding of the pain points, opportunities, and goals. I also
              analyzed some other platforms that are similar to carrot to find
              out their loan strategies and how they structure their repayments.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was able to identified the most things people were concerned
              about when taking loans was in a conversation

        <div className="caseFlex">
          <p>
            I took an understudy of existing loan/lending platforms to take a
            sample data of hope they run their operations both manually and
            automated. Loan processes differ pending on organisations. I
            conducted a research on a few of them and I was able to pinpoint the
            baisc features/flow they all had. Below are my procedural findings

            I went on to carry out a survey with a couple of questions, trying

            their experiences with stock, loans and lending platforms, here are

            The mobile application was designed with simplicity and minimalism
            in mind, the three splash screens highlights the three most sought
            after features of the product. These onboarding screens priortises
            what the app does over how to use the app. This method is advocated
            for the app owners that want their users to understand how the app
            functions which we achieved by designing related visuals and text in
            the app onboarding screens.

            The product has a very consice sign up process, you might call this

            card screen is used to add card for repayments which is mandatory to
